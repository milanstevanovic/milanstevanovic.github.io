# Hello, I'm Milan Stevanović

Welcome to my personal space on the web. This isn't just a portfolio—it's the story of my journey through the world of technology, from a curious kid in Serbia to now co-founding a stealth startup focused on mental well-being technology.

## The Beginning

My fascination with computers started early. Growing up in Serbia, I was that kid who would rather figure out how programs worked than just use them. This curiosity led me down a path that would shape my entire career.

## The Journey Continues

Through years of learning, building, and breaking things (and then fixing them), I've had the privilege of working with amazing teams and technologies. From developing iOS applications that serve millions of users to now building the technical foundation for my own company, each project has been a chapter in this ongoing story.

Currently, I'm Co-Founder & CTO of a stealth startup in the mindfulness space, where I'm driving the technical strategy and personally developing the iOS application that aims to reduce stress and elevate mental well-being.

## What You'll Find Here

Below, you'll discover some of the key projects and experiences that have defined my career. Each one represents not just technical achievements, but lessons learned, challenges overcome, and the joy of creating something meaningful.
