## Summary

I build products from zero to exit.

Started out coding iOS apps, scaled to Product Manager at BUX (€100M+ neobroker), then became a CTO. Now I help startups navigate the entire journey - from napkin sketch to cap table, from first line of code to Series A metrics.

What I actually do:
- Product Strategy: Transform ideas into products people pay for. I've built fintech apps with millions in revenue and wellness platforms from scratch.
- Technical Due Diligence: Evaluate tech stacks, teams, and burn rates. I speak both VC and developer.
- Team Assembly: Connect startups with battle-tested engineering teams globally. Built development hubs in Serbia, managed teams in Netherlands, Dubai, and beyond.

My sweet spot:
- Fintech startups that need someone who can read both code and term sheets. I've been an Engineer who wrote code, the Product Manager who shipped, the CTO who hired, and now I'm the advisor who's seen all the mistakes.
