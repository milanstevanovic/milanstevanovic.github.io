# The Mission: Democratize Investing for Everyone

When I joined BUX as a founding iOS engineer in 2017, retail investing was complex, expensive, and intimidating. Traditional brokerages charged high fees and offered confusing interfaces that scared away everyday investors.

Our mission was clear: build a mobile-first investment platform that makes trading stocks, ETFs, and fractional shares as simple as using any other app on your phone.
