# The Strategic Challenge: Expanding Beyond Mobile

By 2021, BUX's mobile app had achieved remarkable success with 1M+ users across Europe. But our data revealed a critical opportunity: users wanted advanced features that were better suited for larger screensâ€”detailed portfolio analysis, complex charting, and educational content.

As Product Manager, I was tasked with bringing BUX to the web while maintaining our mobile-first DNA and user experience excellence.

## The Product Strategy: Complementary, Not Duplicate

**The Insight**: Web wasn't just a bigger mobile app. Desktop users have different behaviors, needs, and interaction patterns.

**My Approach**:
- **Mobile**: Optimized for quick trading, notifications, and on-the-go portfolio checks
- **Web**: Focused on analysis, research, and educational content consumption
- **Seamless Integration**: Real-time sync between platforms with consistent data and user state

## Design Innovation: Rethinking Information Architecture

**The Challenge**: Mobile apps use sequential navigation (swipe, tap, navigate). Desktop users expect simultaneous information access.

**My Solution**: Developed a unified dashboard that combined multiple mobile screens into one comprehensive view:
- Live portfolio performance
- Real-time watchlist updates
- Integrated news feed
- Advanced charting tools
- All visible simultaneously without context switching

## Building the Right Team

**The Leadership Challenge**: We needed to build an entirely new engineering team specialized in web technologies while maintaining our mobile-first culture.

**My Approach**:
- **Hired for Complementary Skills**: Found web engineers who understood mobile constraints
- **Cross-Platform Collaboration**: Established shared design systems and API standards
- **User-Centered Focus**: Ensured both teams prioritized user experience over technical preferences

## The Results: Expanding Market Reach

**User Growth**:
- 40% increase in user engagement across platforms
- 25% of new users now start on web before adopting mobile
- 60% of power users regularly use both platforms

**Product Impact**:
- Advanced users stay 3x longer on platform
- Educational content consumption increased 200%
- Professional traders began choosing BUX over traditional platforms

## Technical Leadership: Bridging Mobile and Web

**API Strategy**: Led the development of unified APIs that served both mobile and web, reducing development complexity and ensuring feature parity.

**Performance Optimization**: Applied mobile-first performance principles to web, achieving faster load times than traditional desktop trading platforms.

**Responsive Design**: Ensured the web platform worked seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and even mobile browsers.

## Why This Experience Matters

**Multi-Platform Product Strategy**: Demonstrated ability to expand successful products across platforms while maintaining brand consistency and user experience.

**Technical Leadership**: Managed engineering teams across different technology stacks, ensuring architectural coherence and shared standards.

**User-Centered Design**: Applied deep user research to make platform-specific design decisions rather than following industry conventions.

**Growth Focus**: Translated product expansion into measurable business outcomes and user growth.

**Team Building**: Successfully hired and integrated new engineering talent while maintaining company culture and product quality.
