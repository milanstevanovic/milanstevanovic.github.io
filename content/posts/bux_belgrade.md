# The Business Challenge: Scaling Engineering Talent

By 2022, BUX had reached product-market fit with 1M+ users, but faced a critical constraint: Amsterdam's competitive tech talent market was limiting our engineering growth. We needed to expand internationally while maintaining our culture and technical standards.

As Country General Manager for Serbia, I was tasked with establishing our first international engineering hub from scratch.
