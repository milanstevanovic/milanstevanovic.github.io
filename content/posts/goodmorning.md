# The Mission: Making Wellness Accessible Through Technology

In a world where stress and burnout have become endemic, I partnered with [Chris Zadeh](https://www.whangai.nl/about-the-founder) - serial entrepreneur and founder of [Ohpen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohpen) - to create something meaningful: an app that brings scientifically-backed breathwork techniques to everyone's pocket.

As Co-founder and CTO of [Goodmorning](https://www.goodmorning.me/), I didn't just build an app - I built an entire company from the ground up.

## What I'm Building: From First Line of Code to Full Product

**The iOS App** (2025 - Ongoing)
- **The Challenge**: Create an intuitive interface for complex breathing patterns
- **My Solution**: Native iOS app with SwiftUI MVVM architecture
- **Technical Stack**: Swift, SwiftUI, Rive for stunning animations, Core Audio
- **AI Integration**: Using Claude Code with MCP for Figma designs, Linear tasks, and Google Workspace automation
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs AI for natural, calming voice guidance

**Full-Stack Architecture**
- **Frontend**: SwiftUI with MVVM pattern for clean, testable code
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with Kotlin for type-safe, scalable APIs
- **Infrastructure**: Automated CI/CD pipelines for both iOS and backend
- **AI-Powered Development**: Leveraging Claude Code's MCP integrations to accelerate development

**Breathing Exercise Engine**
- **The Challenge**: Synchronize audio guidance, visual cues, and haptic feedback
- **My Solution**: Custom timing engine with Rive animations for smooth visuals
- **Features**: Multiple breathing patterns, AI-generated voice guidance, progress tracking
- **Innovation**: Real-time synchronization between animation, audio, and haptics

**Wellness Analytics Platform**
- **The Challenge**: Track user progress while respecting privacy
- **My Solution**: On-device analytics with optional cloud sync via Spring Boot backend
- **Privacy First**: All health data encrypted and user-controlled
- **Architecture**: Event-driven design for real-time insights

## Beyond Code: Building a Company from Zero

As CTO and Co-founder, my responsibilities extended far beyond writing code:
