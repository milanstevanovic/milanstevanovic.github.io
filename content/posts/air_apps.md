# The Challenge: Managing Multiple iOS Apps at Scale

When I joined [AirApps](https://airapps.co/) as Product Manager, I inherited a complex ecosystem. The company had built a portfolio of successful iOS apps, including Translate Now (featured in Apple's 2023 WWDC keynote), but faced the challenge of managing multiple applications efficiently while maintaining innovation speed.

Each app had distinct user bases, technical requirements, and growth trajectories. The traditional approach of building custom solutions for each app was becoming unsustainable.

## What I Built: A Unified Backend-as-a-Service Platform

**The Solution**: I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) and SDK that would become the foundation for all AirApps products.

**Key Features Delivered**:
- Offline/online data synchronization
- User account management and profiles
- Plug-and-play architecture for rapid deployment
- Standardized APIs across all applications

**Impact**: This framework accelerated our development timeline by 60% and enabled consistent user experiences across our entire app portfolio.

## Leading AI Innovation: The Hello AI Project

As Product Manager for **Hello AI**, I was among the first to integrate OpenAI's GPT APIs into a consumer mobile application. This required:

- **Technical Leadership**: Working directly with engineers to architect AI-powered features
- **Product Strategy**: Defining user experience patterns for AI interactions
- **Market Positioning**: Launching an AI app before the current AI boom

## Why This Matters for Your Team

**Bridge Technical and Business**: My engineering background allowed me to collaborate effectively with developers while maintaining product vision alignment.

**Rapid Innovation**: Demonstrated ability to identify emerging technologies (AI integration) and translate them into market-ready products.

**Scalable Solutions**: Built systems that support multiple products simultaneously, reducing development overhead and time-to-market.

**Cross-Platform Expertise**: Experience managing products across the entire iOS ecosystem, from consumer apps to enterprise solutions.
